## Features
> ScaleInfoGuitar
        ⬜ Popup to change Tuning (see usePopup)
        ✅ Add numbers below frets
        ✅ Highlight 'significant notes' to fretboard

> ScaleInfoScale
        🔲 Add numbers for chords

> Create `usePopup` hook
        🔲 Make popup change direction when reaching bottom or side of page
        🐞 Reveal direction doesn't take into account a user's scroll position

> useScale
        🐞 Need to add form control so JForm elements are updated by localStorage

## Bug Fixes
🐞 Fix iOS display issues
🐞 ScaleInfoScale - Chord Name clipping when scaled

## Long-run Goals
> Make elements modular
        - Add/remove components
            Guitar, Piano, Saxaphone, etc.
        - Allow to reorder via drag / dropping
